Process Description - Populate Client Customer via CSV

Assumptions:
Assumed schema is CLIENT_CUSTOMER_NAME, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_EXTERNAL ID, or customer format mapped to these fields.
Process may need to be repeated with this client or another.
We will use an ETL pipeline. This is modeled on Azure Data Factory but could be a tool with similar capabilities.
Customer will not include a reference to himself in the dataset, we will need to manually pass this parameter.



1. General - Receive client file from customer. No method of receipt specified, could be email, file exchange etc.
2. Pipeline - Copy customer file to blob storage ingestion directory
3. Pipeline - Run validation activity against a reference file with the same schema. Ensure is valid CSV and valid schema
4. Pipeline - Run SQL statement to truncate before load.
	TRUNCATE TABLE STG.STG_NEW_CLIENT_CUSTOMER

5. Pipelione - Run copy data activity to copy csv blob to SQL staging table. Target insertion procedure, pass @CLIENTID at runtime.
	CREATE PROCEDURE DBO.USP_INSERT_NEW_CLIENT_CUSTOMER @CLIENT_ID INT AS
	BEGIN
	INSERT INTO STG.NEW_CLIENT_CUSTOMER (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_EXTERNAL_ID, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_NAME)
	VALUES (@CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_EXTERNAL_ID, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_NAME)
	END


6. Pipeline - Execute procedure to load stage data to client customer table

	CREATE PROCEDURE DBO.USP_INSERT_NEW_CLIENT_CUSTOMER @CLIENT_ID INT AS
		BEGIN
		INSERT INTO DBO.CLIENT_CUSTOMER (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_EXTERNAL_ID, CLIENT_CUSTOMER_NAME)
			SELECT @CLIENT_ID
    		,CLIENT_CUSTOMER_EXTERNAL_ID
    		,CLIENT_CUSTOMER NAME
		FROM STG.NEW_CLIENT_CUSTOMER
		END
